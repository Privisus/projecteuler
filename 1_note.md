Translating and understanding the problem was relatively easy. A bruteforce
solution shouldn't be a problem since the bound is relatively low (999).

The problem stated:  
"Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000."

Bruteforce solution is iterating each number from 1 to 999 that is divisible by
3 or 5. Example:

`(rem 6 5)` would yield 1 because the remainder is 1, because it has a
remainder, it is not divisble by 5.

SOLUTION: 233168
