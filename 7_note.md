I counted 2 3 5 7 11 first as prime numbers then proceed to fast filter the
next odd numbers to see if they are divisble by 3, 5, 7, or 11. This saved a
little time on computing power.

If they aren't, then proceed to iterate from 12 to sqrt(number) 
to see if they are divisible by any factor. If they aren't, it is a prime
number. It continues until it reaches the 10001st prime.

SOLUTION: 104743
